^ The Command Pattern

^ Note to the reader: This document is written in [Markdown], a somewhat human-readable markup language. It is processed by a program called [DeckSet], which turns it into a presentation. DeckSet does various things such as treating every paragraph that begins with a caret (`^`) into a speaker's note that is not visible to the audience.

[Markdown]: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Markdown
[DeckSet]: http://www.decksetapp.com

^ You may be looking at a partially-rendered version of this document, thanks to GitHub's ability to render basic MarkDown in the browser as formatted text. If so, you can look at the original document by clicking the [Raw] link above.

[Raw]: https://raw.githubusercontent.com/raganwald/presentations/master/command-pattern-2017.md

^ The fully rendered slides are on [SpeakerDeck], and you can download a PDF there as well.

[SpeakerDeck]: https://speakerdeck.com/raganwald/first-class-commands-an-unexpectedly-fertile-design-pattern

^ Some people have pointed out that DeckSet's MarkDown is not an excellent format for reading the material as compared to an essay. This is true. In its favour, you can't read a PowerPoint or KeyNote presentation's raw file *at all*, nor can you do interesting things like submit your own [pull request] on GitHub, so MarkDown does have some interesting affordances.

# First-Class Commands
### an unexpectedly fertile design pattern

^ Let's get started

---

![](images/command/underwood.jpg)

## the canonical example:

# mutable data

---

```javascript
class Buffer {
  constructor (text = '') { this.text = text; }

  replaceWith (replacement, from = 0, to = this.text.length) {
    this.text = this.text.slice(0, from) +
                  replacement +
                  this.text.slice(to);
    return this;
  }

  toString () { return this.text; }
}
```

---

```javascript
let buffer = new Buffer();

buffer.replaceWith(
  "The quick brown fox jumped over the lazy dog"
);
buffer.replaceWith("fast", 4, 9);
buffer.replaceWith("canine", 40, 43);
 //=> The fast brown fox jumped over the lazy canine
```

---

## `buffer`
# is an object

---

# we treat objects as first-class entities

![](images/command/red-rollers.jpg)

^ https://www.flickr.com/photos/mwichary/2406482529

---

## `replaceWith`
# is a method

---

# we can treat methods as first-class entities

![](images/command/press.jpg)

^ https://www.flickr.com/photos/tompagenet/8580371564

^ e.g. decorators

---

## `buffer.replaceWith("fast", 4, 9)`
# is an invocation

---

# what does it mean to treat an invocation as a first-class entity?

![](images/command/print-room.jpg)

^ https://www.flickr.com/photos/ooocha/2869485136

^ Talk about invocations being ephemeral and tied up with mutable state, some visible, some hidden.

---

# storing invocations

![](images/command/hp2600n.jpg)

^ https://www.flickr.com/photos/oskay/2550938136

---

```javascript
class Edit {
  constructor (buffer, {replacement, from, to}) {
    this.buffer = buffer;
    Object.assign(this, {replacement, from, to});
  }

  doIt () {
    this.buffer.text =
      this.buffer.text.slice(0, this.from) +
      this.replacement +
      this.buffer.text.slice(this.to);
    return this.buffer;
  }
}
```

---

```javascript
class Buffer {
  constructor (text = '') { this.text = text; }

  replaceWith (replacement, from = 0, to = this.text.length) {
    return new Edit(this, {replacement, from, to});
  }

  toString () { return this.text; }
}
```

---

```javascript
let buffer = new Buffer(), jobQueue = [];

jobQueue.push(
  buffer.replaceWith(
    "The quick brown fox jumped over the lazy dog"
  )
);
jobQueue.push( buffer.replaceWith("fast", 4, 9) );
jobQueue.push( buffer.replaceWith("canine", 40, 43) );

while (jobQueue.length > 0) {
  jobQueue.shift().doIt();
}
 //=> The fast brown fox jumped over the lazy canine
```

^ Presto, a job queue!

---

# job queues

![](images/command/houston-chronicale.jpg)

^ https://www.flickr.com/photos/eschipul/1219204898)
^ Deferred execution
^ Asynchronous execution

---

![fit](images/command/enqueued.png)

^ chaining and handling serialization
^ cancel
^ ember concurrency: task instances are like commands, tasks are like job queues

---

# querying invocations

![](images/command/keyboard.jpg)

^ https://www.flickr.com/photos/baccharus/4474584940

---

```javascript
class Edit {

  netChange () {
    return this.from - this.to + this.replacement.length;
  }

}
```

---

```javascript
let buffer = new Buffer();

buffer.replaceWith(
    "The quick brown fox jumped over the lazy dog"
).netChange();
 //=> 44

buffer.replaceWith("fast", 4, 9).netChange();
 //=> -1
```

---

# command state

---

![fit](images/command/acknowledging.png)

^ status
^ queue control versus debouncing functions

---

# command history

---

![fit](images/command/timeline.png)

^ logs as first-class entities
^ tracking behaviour

^ traditional logs are terrible and opaque
^ why litter our UX code with tracking invocations?

---

# transforming invocations

![](images/command/stamps.jpg)

^ https://www.flickr.com/photos/micurs/4906349993

^ combinators, combinators, combinators

---

```javascript
class Edit {

  reversed () {
    let replacement = this.buffer.text.slice(this.from, this.to),
        from = this.from,
        to = from + this.replacement.length;
    return new Edit(buffer, {replacement, from, to});
